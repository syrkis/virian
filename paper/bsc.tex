\begin{abstract}
    Costly international social surveys are conducted by various institutions with yearly time granularity
    \footnote{The European Social Survey and the World Value Survey release rounds every two and seven years, respectively.}.
    Here a potential method for inferring summary statistics of a given country's response to a subset of the European Social Survey (ESS), from the reading activity in that country's associated Wikipedia project, is explored.
    The ESS subset consists of 21 questions about human values, each answered by respondents on a scale from 1 to 6.
    A one-to-one mapping between countries and Wikipedia projects is assumed, while a neural model is trained to predict if a given day's reading activity comes from a country with a high or low mean and standard deviation for the ESS questions.
    The model thus attempts to answer the question ``\emph{given only a sample of a countries Wikipedia reading activity, can something be inferred about the cultural values that country?}''
    The experiment does \emph{not} yield a positive result, indicating that the assumptions on which it rests are too incorrect.
    Code and experiment replication instructions are available at
    \href{https://github.com/syrkis/bsc}{\texttt{github.com/syrkis/bsc}}.
