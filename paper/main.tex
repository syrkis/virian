\begin{abstract}
    International social surveys are conducted by various institutions\footnote{The European Social Survey and the World Value Survey releases rounds every two and seven years respectively.} with yearly time granularity.
    Here a method for inferring nation-specifc distributions of answers to the European Social Survey from view-count weigthed Wikipedia reading activity is proposed.
    Specifically a neural model is train to predict the mean and variance of the five most doninant factors to to the subset of questions seen in Appendeix A for the countries seen in Appendix B.
    The method is designed to be time scale agnostic, though the experiemental setup is only able to evaluate biu-yearly accuracy (the \texttt{ESS} is conduced every second year).
    The mean and variance of the distribution of the most relevant factors of the responese matrix these can \emph{1)} be predcited for unknown countries, and \emph{2)} assign means and variance to these factors at arbitaray time scalesâ€”be it with decreasing certaitnty.
    Code and replication instructions are available at \href{https://github.com/syrkis/bsc}{\texttt{github.com/syrkis/bsc}}.
