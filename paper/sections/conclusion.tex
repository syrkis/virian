The experiment, achiving and overall accuracy of 0.6 with a $p$-value of 0.003, shows that a mapping between reading activity and cutlural states \emph{can} be infered.

The models inference is within 1 stanTdard deviation of the true value component average and distribution 95\% of the time. When doing per quarter prediction the perormance does drop, though whether this is due to unquantified chagnes in cultural states or model error can not be discovered with the current experimental setup.
