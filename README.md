Research project into inferring cultural values (European Social Survey response distributions) from population reading activity (daily 1000 most read articles in associated Wikipedia project).
As algorithmically curated content consumption proliferates, a mapping between content and values is increasingly important.
This an exploration of that.

docker run syrkis/bsc
