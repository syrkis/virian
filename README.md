# Virian Pentaglyph NLP

*This repository is under active development and things might break. Currently I am trying to use word and document embeddings and auto encoders, PCA and cosine similarity to determine how western culture changes through time.*

Current game plan:
— Compute 5d document embeddings for wikipedia summaries using auto encoders and tf-idf weights.
— Assign each of the 5d's to an MFT dimension by cosine similarity (evaualte goodness of fit).
— Deploy to virian pentaglyph
