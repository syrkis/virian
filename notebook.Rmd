## Introduction
The European Social Survey (ESS) is face-to-face a biennial survey conducted since 2001 in more than thirty European countries. The survey is broad (questions are in the hundreds) with topics ranging from 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
